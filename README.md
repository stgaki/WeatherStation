# WeatherStation
 The weatherStation implements the Observer Design Pattern. 
 The subject is the WeatherStation which keeps measurement data that takes from sensors like temperature, humidity and pressure. 
 The observers like UserInterface, Logger and Alert are all interested in these data and they get notified when WeatherStation gets new data from the sensors. 
 The design allows Observers to easily be registered and unregistered for notifications of the WeatherStation.
